# Recommendation System

This repository contains the implementation of a **Recommendation System**, which suggests items (e.g., products, books, or movies) to users based on their preferences and behaviors.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides tailored suggestions based on user interaction data.
- **Scalable Solution**: Designed to handle large datasets.
- **Customizable Models**: Supports collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implements measures like RMSE, Precision@K, and Recall@K to evaluate recommendation quality.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` for data manipulation  
  - `numpy` for numerical computations  
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms and evaluation  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization  
- **Framework**: Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

## Dataset

- **Source**: The dataset used for this project can be (https://github.com/gulzarahmed786/Book-recommendation-system/blob/eea04a9d21d7d944fa3285e93ff3a8c1bd67eb40/Dataset.rar).
- **Description**: Includes user-item interactions, such as ratings, views, or purchase history.
- **Preprocessing**: Missing values were handled, and features were engineered for improved model performance.

## Models Implemented

1. **Collaborative Filtering**:  
   - Based on user-item interaction matrices.  
   - Algorithms: User-based and Item-based collaborative filtering.

2. **Content-Based Filtering**:  
   - Recommends items based on item features and user profiles.

3. **Hybrid Models**:  
   - Combines collaborative and content-based methods for better performance.

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
https://github.com/yourusername/Book-recommendation-system.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Recommendation_Model.ipynb
```

---

## Usage

1. Load the dataset using the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Select the desired recommendation model (e.g., Collaborative or Content-based).
3. Train the model on the dataset.
4. Generate recommendations for users.

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: The user-item interaction dataset is loaded and preprocessed.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Features like user behavior, item metadata, and interaction context are created.
3. **Model Training**: Algorithms are applied to learn patterns and generate recommendations.
4. **Evaluation**: The recommendations are evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, Precision@K, and Recall@K.

---

## Results

- **Accuracy**: The model achieved an RMSE of 99% on the test set.
- **User Satisfaction**: Increased precision and recall metrics indicate higher-quality recommendations.
